# Book Bot :books::robot:
Book Bot analyzes an entire book in a text file and prints out a statistical report while using Git and GitHub to store my code. Additionally, this project guided me through the setup of VS Code and using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Book Bot is my first Python project on Boot.dev.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** :snake: Python 3.12.3

This project is split up into seven (7) individual functions that are intended for a specific purpose:

```main()``` is the starting point for the execution of Book Bot. It sets up the required variables needed and passes them to the functions listed below to create and print out a report. This function does not accept any arguments and is automatically called when ```main.py``` is run from the command line using the ```if __name__ == "__main__"``` conditional statement.

```get_book_contents()``` 


```get_word_count()```


```get_char_count()```


```print_report()```


```char_dict_to_list()```


```sort_on()```


## Lessons Learned:

WIP

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
